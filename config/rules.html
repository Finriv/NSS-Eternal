<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="1"> 1. Regarding Admin Interaction </span></h2>
<p>All admin interaction is to be taken seriously. If an admin has taken the time to observe an action you've done as being unruly do not ignore them. If you feel as though an admin is antagonizing you intentionally please post these concerns to the forums. You will be banned temporarily for leaving during an admin intervention. A ban multiplier will also be applied should the admin find you guilty of breaking another rule.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="2"> 2. Regarding Admin Judgement </span></h2>
<p>Under no circumstances are you allowed to insult or disobey an admin ruling. If you are upset and feel as though the admin was wrong, they are NOT the person to express this to. We have a forums where you may post your opinions on the administration, and appeal the Judgement, if you feel the need.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="3"> 3. Regarding traitor interactions </span></h2>
<p>Being a traitor or antagonist generally means you get a bit more freedom with how you interact with the world around you. However, this does not mean kill everyone if your objective is only to kill a certain target. Use common sense and decide who is useful to kill and who is not.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="4"> 4. Regarding Special Events </span></h2>
<p>If you feel the desire to opt out of a special admin event please send an Ahelp rather than trying to take matters into your own hand. An administrator will try to work with you to make the event more enjoyable, or work on getting you out of it.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="5"> 5. Regarding Suicide </span></h2>
<p>We advise having real reasons to commit suicide. Refrain from doing so if you find yourself in the brig for any time under 20 minutes, or in an attempt to join a special event. We try to reserve special events for those that are already dead.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="6"> 6. Regarding Offensive Language </span></h2>
<p>We ask that you keep all offensive remarks, opinions, and discussions out of OOC. The administration may disable OOC if they feel it's needed to break up a discussion. Anything that is taken as unnecessarily racist/sexist/discriminatory WILL NOT be tolerated and will result in a ban.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="7"> 7. Regarding OOC Chatter </span></h2>
<p>It is a general rule of thumb to keep OOC chat to a minimum to prevent it from being disabled. Do not relay IC information here, do not talk about things that are irrelevant here, and try to refrain from asking questions here related to administration matters.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="8"> 8. Regarding Griefing </span></h2>
<p>Only under special circumstances are you allowed to cause direct harm to the station's integrity or crew's health. This includes dismantling walls, causing explosions, intentionally harming other players as a non-antag, and disrupting station atmospherics. There are several things antags are forbidden from doing, so if you find yourself questioning your action please send an Ahelp before hand!</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="9"> 9.  Regarding Metagaming</span></h2>
<p>Metagaming is the practice of using OOC knowledge to directly benefit you IC. This  may include characters having knowledge that's practically impossible  for them to know. (I.E A Chef setting up the singularity engine.) We  advise against this. Another example is using third party forms of  communication such as Teamspeak, Ventrilo, or Mumble in order to relay  information about your character or the current round. If you are caught  doing this, you will receive a ban depending on the severity of it.</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="10"> 10. Regarding AI </span></h2>
<p>As an AI you are bound to interpret and follow your laws for the better interest of yourself and the station. Do not, under normal circumstances, follow laws which tell you to kill everyone or destroy  the station. Assisting antagonists is only acceptable if you have been subverted accordingly. You will be considered for a job ban from AI and/or Cyborg if you break this rule. (PM the Admins about this if  unsure)</p>
<p><br></p>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="11"> 11. Metaknowledge of Antagonists </span></h2>
<p>Crew knowledge of antagonists is heavily policed on this server, to ensure an enjoyable round for all players, and exhibiting knowledge of Antag objectives, equipment or abilities beyond a reasonable level for your character's role is punishable by an immediately short-term ban upon the first offense if your actions pose a risk to the quality of the ongoing round for other roleplayers.</p>
