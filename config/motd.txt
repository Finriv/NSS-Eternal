<i><strong>... You've entered the Heaven's Gate Anomalous Zone.</i></strong><br>

Welcome to Heaven's Gate - an evolving, high-level roleplaying community aiming to create the perfect SS13 experience. Please read our server <a href=http://www.heavensgatestation.com/post/briefing-7045067?pid=1283979725#post1283979725>introduction and character briefing</a> before entering play.

A compelling and consistent roleplaying atmosphere is our highest priority - metagaming, powergaming and out-of-character behaviours during play will not be tolerated. We do believe, however, that action, excitement, combat and chaos have their place in the ideal SS13 round - in simple terms, we aim to provide the ideal balance between immersive simulation, deep roleplay, and fun.

Please familiarise yourself with <a href=http://www.heavensgatestation.com/post/rules-6985308?pid=1283527477>our rules</a> before you jump in.

Type 'adminhelp' to contact our friendly crew if you need any help, or have an OOC dispute or complaint.

Thanks for reading - we hope you enjoy.
